## Persistent floating terminal

The new `features.floating_term` module exposes a terminal that opens in a centered floating window and keeps its terminal job alive even after closing the float. Use `<leader>t` to toggle the terminal buffer, or run `:FloatingTerm` from command mode; resizing Vim automatically re-centers the floating window.
